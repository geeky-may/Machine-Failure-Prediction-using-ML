# 🛠️ FaultSense – Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

FaultSense is a machine learning-based predictive maintenance system designed to detect and classify machine failures using sensor data. The project uses the AI4I 2020 dataset to train and evaluate multiple classification models and identify the most accurate model for fault prediction.

This project aims to reduce unexpected machine breakdowns by predicting faults in advance, helping industries improve reliability, efficiency, and maintenance planning.
